## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Chunk 1
2 + 1

# Chunk 2
21:50

# Chunk 3
a <- 2 + 1
b <- 5 - 2
c <- a + b

# Chunk 4
c
print(c)

# Chunk 5
d <- "Hello World"
class(d)

# Chunk 6
e <- TRUE
class(e)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
